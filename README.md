# AI_Seeking_Tic-Tac-Toe
 A small game that came as a result of an AI course, a more modular version of the classic tic-tac-toe game, with a Minimax-AI to play against!

The player is marked with blue circles and the AI is marked with red crosses. I've also given the player the ability to customize the game to a certain degree. Customizable settings include:
* Amount of rows.
* Amount of Columns.
* Minimum amount of tiles in a row needed to win.
* How far down the "game-tree" the minimax AI can search for it's next move.
* If the minimax AI should play as a "tryhard", or if it should be possible for the AI to make less optimal moves every now and again (to give the player a bigger chance of winning).

The settings can be seen with the following screenshot.

The following gif illustrates the game in action.

I've made a unitypackage ready for download, as well as a playable executable inside a .zip-file.
